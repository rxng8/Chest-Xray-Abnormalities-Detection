# Vin Big Data Chest X-RAY Abnormalies Detection - Kaggle Competition

## About the project:
This project is created for academic purpose and also available publicly. More information about the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/).

## Prerequisites:
* [Anaconda]()
* Kaggle API:
  * [Set up kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api). 
  * [Create api key and move the key file to ./kaggle folder.](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/issues/15#issuecomment-500713264).
* If you are using window, you will have to use window's linux subsystem to run the bash script which download the dataset. Or you can download directly from kaggle.

## Process of development:
* Install dataset.
* Visualize data and Data Analysis.
* Write up training pipeline:
  * Data/Dataset Object Structure
  * Data Loader and Data Generator
  * Deep Learning Model
  * Train it!
* Evaluation
* Visualization

# Project Backlog:

## Week 1: Feb 1 - Feb 5:
* Created project pipeline template. More information can be found in issue [#2](https://github.com/rxng8/VINDR-Competition/issues/2)!
* Research about R-CNN. Here is the list of articles I have read:
  * [R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO â€” Object Detection Algorithms](https://towardsdatascience.com/r-cnn-fast-r-cnn-faster-r-cnn-yolo-object-detection-algorithms-36d53571365e)
